          <p><h3>Django Girls PDX | 2016 - Present</h3></p>
          <p>Since 2016 I have been a co-organizer of the Portland chapter of Django Girls. Django Girls is an international non-profit with chapters in cities all over the world that puts on free one day programming workshops that teach people of marginalized genders how to build their first website from the ground up in Python and Django. The Portland chapter has spanned several organizers and put on a total of nine workshops. We strive for accessibility, offering amenities like free onsite childcare and loaner laptops. Itâ€™s a big endeavor to put on such an event for 40 people, but we feel the impact is worth it. Weâ€™ve helped cultivate a community and a safe space for hundreds of folks to get acquainted with programming! </p>

        <p><h3>Project Power | 2018</h3></p>
        <p>In 2018 my colleague <a href="http://www.pineconedoesthings.com/">Terian</a> and I were very fortunate to be able to collaborate with local shop and artist community <a href="https://projectobject.co/">Project Object</a>. As a part of their Project Power series, and with the help of several other organizations in the community, we put on a small introductory programming workshop for people of marginalized genders. For a Sunday afternoon we took over the Project Object shop and put on Terianâ€™s <a href="https://tpinecone.gitbooks.io/diy-sex-robot/content/index.html">DIY Sex Robot</a> workshop for 15 attendees. All attendees got to keep their Arduino kits afterwards, and the workshop was a big success.</p><br>

        <p>Hopefully more exciting projects to comeâ€¦ ðŸ‘€</p>
